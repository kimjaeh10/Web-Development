# myWebsite
Using knowledge that I gained from the last folder (Intro to CSS), I built a very simple responsive website.

### Responsive
Initially, main floats left 70% and sidebar floats right 30% in the webpage.
However, if the width of the website is less than 600px, main and sidebar won't be stay side by side.

### Other features
* Created navbar using unordered list
* Imported background images
* Set a minimum height for showcase
* Designed web
